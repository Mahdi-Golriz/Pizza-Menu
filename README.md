- I have recently started to learn the React through a course from the Udemy instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann. During this course I should develop many training task, projects and applications. This the first task of this course :).
- The simplest one!
- In this section I learned about:
  * How the React works through rendering the Root component
  * Defining, creating and reusing a component
  * JSX
  * Styling the components by inline styling and external CSS file
  * Props (passing and recivieng, immutablity and one-way-data flow)
  * Rendering lists and conditional rendering
  * Extractign JSX into a new component
  * Destructuring Props, React fragment 
  * Setting classes and text conditionally
 
- ## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React & Create React App

## Setup
This repository consists of two branches:
* master - the source code of the React app
